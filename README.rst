Legion
------

This is a simple, but powerful load engine project.

During my work I often skip load testing, because it was too hard to develop and setup.
With this tool I do it in no time.

What I need:

* write simple test should be simple
* ability use it as library to develop custom tools
* run test from single machine should be very simple
* ability to generate load test from many agent if needed should be simple

Now Legion completely satisfy my requirements. Often I write simple load tests in 10-20 minutes and I happy with it.
